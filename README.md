# Simple Apps in C 

A collection of simple C applications for personal use and language practice.

## Description

This repository contains a set of basic C programs that perform various simple tasks, including mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, etc.), palindrome checks, array shuffling, and more. These programs serve as a personal learning exercise and may be useful for reference in the future.

## Usage

Each program is contained in its own directory and can be compiled and executed independently. You can follow these general steps to run the programs:

1. Navigate to the program's directory.
2. Compile the source code (e.g., `gcc math_add.c -o math_add`).
3. Run the executable (e.g., `./math_add`).

These programs can also be set up as aliases for convenience. To create an alias, you can add the following line to your `./zshrc` or `./bashrc` file:

```bash
alias shuffle='path/to/shuffle'

## Disclaimer

These programs are simple exercises and may not be optimized for production use. They are primarily intended for personal learning and experimentation.

Feel free to explore the code and adapt it for your own projects or learning purposes.
